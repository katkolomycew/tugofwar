# tugofwar

This was a first-time project to be completed within 2 hours, set by _nology on my third week of the course.

The requirements were to create a Tug of War game, with HTML and CSS and JS in one file, and for it to be as responsive as possible for two players.

I completed it within the 2 hours, and added extra responsiveness in the form of tablet and mobile displays.
